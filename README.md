# XNM

XNM is a recursive acronym for XNM is not a MACE.

XNM is a game manager developed for homemade arcades machines with emulators, totally inspirated by MACE project developed and saled by [Fabio Nolasco, A.K.A (Gigante Gue-Hero)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfy-nX6MoA1EmQBi1Ibh1xA), developed in Javascript using a NUXT boilerplate called [vue-stack](https://github.com/samuelnovaes/vue-stack) by [Samuel Novaes](http://github.com/samuelnovaes).

>This project is in an initial state of development, it does not contain well-made screens, it must contain bugs and only a few emulators are configured.

### WARNING
This is not a OS, is just an application that should be run on node.js, with emulators installed in a system preferably on LINUX.
